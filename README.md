# NOX-detection-using-random-forest-and-cnn

In these project random forest and Convolutional Neural Network is used to predict total amount of Nitrogen Oxide leakage in a chemical industry.

Dataset has data for 9 corresponding sensors, placed at different location in the plant.

All the other relevant information is given in the code itself.
